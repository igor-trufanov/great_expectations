title: Integration support policy
---

For production environments, GX recommends using the integrations defined as GX-supported.

GX uses libraries such as Pandas, Spark, and SQLAlchemy to integrate with different Data Sources. This also allows you to deploy GX with community-supported integrations.

## Support categories

The following are the levels of support provided by GX:

- GX-supported - integrations are tested throughout the development lifecycle and are actively maintained and updated when new GX Cloud or GX OSS versions are released.

- Community-supported - integrations are implemented by the community or GX. GX is not responsible for ensuring integration reliability or compatibility.

## GX-supported

The following are the levels of support offered by GX for integrated applications, operating systems, and programming languages.

<sup>1</sup> We've also seen GX work with the following data sources in the past but we can't guarentee ongoing compatibility. These data sources include Clickhouse, Vertica, Dremio, Teradata, Athena, EMR Spark, AWS Glue, Microsoft Fabric, Trino, Pandas on (S3, GCS, Azure), Databricks (Spark), and Spark on (S3, GCS, Azure).<br/>
<sup>2</sup> Support for BigQuery in GX Cloud will be available in a future release.<br/>
<sup>3</sup> This includes configuration storage for Expectations, Checkpoints, Validation Definitions, and Validation Result<br/>
<sup>4</sup> config_variables.yml<br/>
<sup>5</sup> Although only Airflow is supported, GX Cloud and GX Core should work with any orchestrator that executes Python code.<br/>
<sup>6</sup> Airflow version 2.9.0+ required<br/>
