description: Create and manage Expectations in GX Cloud.
---

An Expectation is a verifiable assertion about your data. They make implicit assumptions about your data explicit, and they provide a flexible, declarative language for describing expected behavior. They can help you better understand your data and help you improve data quality.

<!-- [//]: # (TODO: To learn more about Expectations, see Expectation.) -->

## Prerequisites

- You have a [Data Asset](/cloud/data_assets/manage_data_assets.md#create-a-data-asset).

## Available Expectations

The following table lists the available GX Cloud Expectations.

## Custom SQL Expectations

GX Cloud also offers the ability to write a custom Expectation using SQL. It is designed to fail validation if the provided SQL query returns one or more rows.

The provided query should be written in the dialect of the Data Source in which a given Data Asset lives.

:::info Optional `{batch}` named query

The optional `{batch}` named query references the Batch of data under test. When the Expectation is evaluated, the `{batch}` named query will be replaced with the Batch of data that is validated.

:::

## Dynamic Parameters

Dynamic Parameters allow you to create Expectations whose parameters update based on new data. GX Cloud can populate new Expectation parameters at runtime using the last `n` validation results. For example, you can define an Expectation to validate that the maximum value within a column does not exceed 20% above a previously recorded value.

You will be able to input:

1. Sensitivity: `X%` of the average of previous values

2. Constraint: `Above`, `below`, or `above and below` for the sensitivity threshold

3. Run count: `n` previous validation results

When you select your `n` run count, and: 

- There are `0` previous runs, the Expectation will always succeed.

- There are `<n` runs, the Expectation will take all previous runs into account.

- There are `n` runs, the Expectation will take the last `n` runs into account.

- There are `>n` runs, the Expectation will take the last `n` runs into account.


![GX Cloud dynamic parameters](./expectation_images/dynamic_parameters.png)


## Add an Expectation

1. In GX Cloud, click **Data Assets**.

2. In the **Data Assets** list, click the Data Asset name.

3. Click **New Expectation**.

4. Select an Expectation type. See [Available Expectations](#available-expectations).

5. Complete the mandatory and optional fields for the Expectation. A recurring [validation schedule](/cloud/schedules/manage_schedules.md) will be applied automatically to your Expectation. 

6. Click **Save** or click **Save & Add More** and then repeat steps 3 through 6 to add additional Expectations.

7. Optional. Run a Validation. See [Run a Validation](/cloud/validations/manage_validations.md#run-a-validation).


## Optional. Define a Batch

If your Data Asset has at least one DATE or DATETIME column, you can define a Batch to validate your data incrementally.

1. In GX Cloud, click **Data Assets**.

2. In the **Data Assets** list, click the Data Asset name.

3. Click the **Expectations** tab.

4. Click **Define batch**.

5. Choose how to **Validate by**. Select the **Entire Asset** tab to provide all Data Asset records to your Expectations and validations, or select one of the **Year**/**Month**/**Day** tabs to use subsets of Data Asset records for your Expectations and validations. **Year** partitions Data Asset records by year, **Month** partitions Data Asset records by year and month, **Day** partitions Data Asset records by year, month, and day.

6. Select the **Batch column** that contains the DATE or DATETIME data to partition on.

## Edit an Expectation

1. In GX Cloud, click **Data Assets**.

2. In the **Data Assets** list, click the Data Asset name.

3. Click the **Expectations** tab.

4. Click **Edit Expectation** for the Expectation that you want to edit.

5. Edit the Expectation configuration.

6. Click **Save**.

## Delete an Expectation

1. In GX Cloud, click **Data Assets**.

2. In the **Data Assets** list, click the Data Asset name.

3. Click the **Expectations** tab.

4. Click **Delete Expectation** for the Expectation you want to delete.

5. Click **Yes, delete Expectation**.

## GX-managed vs. API-managed Expectations

In GX Cloud, Expectations can be GX-managed or API-managed.
- GX-managed Expectations are created through the GX Cloud UI.
- API-managed Expectations are created with the API in a GX Cloud Data Context.

If you have both kinds of Expectations, they will be organized in separate tables on the **Expectations** tab as they have different capabilities in the Cloud UI. 

Here is a comparison of key characteristics of GX-managed and API-managed Expectations. 

| Characteristic     | GX-managed Expectation                                                                                                        | API-managed Expectation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

:::note Hidden resources for GX-managed Expectations
To support GX-managed Expectations, we create resources that you typically won't directly interact with. For example, we create a GX-managed Expectation Suite that we use to organize your Expectations. For some workflows you may need to work with these hidden resources, for example, you may need to [find the name of an automatically created Checkpoint](/cloud/connect/connect_airflow.md#create-a-dag-file-for-your-gx-cloud-checkpoint). But, typically you can ignore the existence of these hidden resources.
